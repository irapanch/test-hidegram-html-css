# test-hidegram-html-css

3 files - main.html, main.css, main.js
Page unscrollable
Header and input stick to top and bottom of browser elements to make full page unscrollable
Yellow elements are scrollable and should fill the page 
Make only the blocks
The solution should be adaptable to any device size and should keep the structure 
Avoid JS as much as possible
